Notes:
I'm infected with something

I also have the ability "phase"
Which allows me to run at a wall full speed and have a 1 in 6 chance of passing through it

# Tenets

**_Fight the Greater Evil._** Faced with a choice of fighting my sworn foes or combating a lesser evil, I choose the greater evil.

**_No Mercy for the Wicked._** Ordinary foes might win my mercy, but my sworn enemies do not.

**_By Any Means Necessary._** My qualms can't get in the way of exterminating my foes.

**_Restitution._** If my foes wreak ruin on the world, it is because I failed to stop them. I must help those harmed by their misdeeds.
