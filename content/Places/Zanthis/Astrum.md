Astrum is a fallen human civilization. They had very powerful magic fueled by Illium crystals which are very valuable. Humans pushed the magic too hard and caused an explosion that destroyed their city.

[[The Tome of Preservation]] originated here.

[[Kamrys]] mentioned Astrum is safe "for those who can defend themselves"
