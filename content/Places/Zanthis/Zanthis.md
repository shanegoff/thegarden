Zanthis is the plane of existence we currently find ourselves in.

## Culture
Zanthis seems largely populated with demons, devils, and monsters. Humans seem to live on the edge of society and are uncommon. 

### Vampires
In Zanthis there are different types of vampire. Some are typical undead. Murdered and turned to rabid monsters.

Some vampires are born instead. These vampires are celestial, not undead.

Red eyed vampires are feral animals with nothing in their brain but the need to feed.

Yellow eyed vampires can be reasonable.

Blue eyed vampires are docile and have their blood lust under control.
