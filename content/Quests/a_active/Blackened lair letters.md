# Black Raven Head sealed letter

```
Seventeenth of Nix, Year of the Raven. 

Our Lord asks that you have the facility ready by the twelfth day of Rosa. He will be visiting and there is to be preparations made for his touring of the place. Should he find anything he does not like, he wishes me to let you know that a great many of your number will die as a result. Plan carefully.

Uzzain,Castrum of the Temple of Confractus
```

[Uzzain]({{< ref "Uzzain" >}}) from the [Temple of Confractus]({{< ref "Temple of Confractus" >}}) has been communicating with what appears to be the blackened. We were present in the dungeon the day mentioned in the letter. We hid in the experiment room to long rest on that day.

“The ninth day of Rosa, Year of the Raven. 

It has come to my attention that our agreement needs be rearranged. Meet me in the great canyons of Dragon’s Bane nine days hence and we shall discuss what is needed of you by the church. There have been events and movements in places you would not believe. My brother, We are on the cusp of war and this may be your last chance to be on the winning side. Come to me, I have much to tell you.

Tasatoren, Turrim of the Temple of Confractus"
```

[Tasatoren]({{< ref "Tasatoren" >}}) met someone and seems to be trying to convince the letter recipient to aid the [Temple of Confractus]({{< ref "Temple of Confractus" >}})

# Letter from M

```
The tenth of Viridis, year of the Raven. 

It appears that my little pet is doing well. Continue to feed it and once it grows to the size we discussed, cull whatever food source is left and bring it to me. You are not to kill the creature, allow as many of you to die to transport it here as it takes. I will compensate your people upon your arrival. 

-M
```

We don't know yet who [M]({{< ref "M" >}}) is but the appear to be very important

# Scout 1033

```
Report from Scout 1033, 3rd day of Iris, Year of the Raven. 

There is no movement from the weapons woman or her companions. The long eared one has begun to arm the people and the tattooed one has purified our Source again. The temple will not be happy with us if this continues. We must keep the Source pure, or HE will take issue.
```


# Letter from the doctor

```
“The eleventh day of Rosa, Year of the Raven. 

We have captured the ones who continue to disrupt the Source and we currently have them contained, though we cannot be sure the Exposure will work on them. We are doing what we can, though a shipment of supplies is needed to further test his lord’s theories. A mending should be possible with all that we have found thus far. His Lord will find that things have gone well thus far and two of them have been Implanted as he desired, though the implantations have not melded yet with the others; their bodies are rejecting them. We will try again with a stronger variant. -Doctor Nhexlu”
```

So I'm pretty sure this identifies what [Alondrus Arnulf Gorr]({{< ref "Alondrus Arnulf Gorr" >}}) has been infected with. The doctor we struck down in the [Blackened Lair]({{< ref "Blackened Lair" >}}) mentioned two of us are infected. 

The doctor appears to be trying to form a solution to mend this "Lord" which I'm assuming is [Magnus]({{< ref "Magnus" >}}) until proven otherwise. Or at least one of the avatars of Magnus.
