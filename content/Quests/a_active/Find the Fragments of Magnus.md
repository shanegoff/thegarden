[a_Active]({{< ref "a_Active" >}})

[Asani Blackbriar]({{< ref "Asani Blackbriar" >}}) thinks [Magnus]({{< ref "Magnus" >}}) has been broken into fragments which are scattered across the world. Asani thinks there is a fragment near [Urdye]({{< ref "Urdye" >}}) and we should enlist the help of [Sabra]({{< ref "Sabra" >}}) to find the fragment.

We do not know if the fragments are an echo of Magnus, or if they even know they are a fragment.
