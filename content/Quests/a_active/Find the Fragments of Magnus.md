[[Asani Blackbriar]] thinks [[Magnus]] has been broken into fragments which are scattered across the world. Asani thinks there is a fragment near [[Urdye]] and we should enlist the help of [[Sabra]] to find the fragment.

We do not know if the fragments are an echo of Magnus, or if they even know they are a fragment.
