On our way to [[Urdye]] from [[Asani Blackbriar]]s home we discovered an old human complex. Inside we found some gadgets, and a ritual circle that was used to preserve the last living humans. 

There are thousands of humans in pods in [[The Meat Locker]], and we decided to make a plan on what will happen to these people when we free them.

We have been told to seek out [[Sir Henry]] to see what we should do with these people.
