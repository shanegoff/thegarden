On our way to [Urdye]({{< ref "Urdye" >}}) from [Asani Blackbriar]({{< ref "Asani Blackbriar" >}})s home we discovered an old human complex. Inside we found some gadgets, and a ritual circle that was used to preserve the last living humans. 

There are thousands of humans in pods in [The Meat Locker]({{< ref "The Meat Locker" >}}), and we decided to make a plan on what will happen to these people when we free them.

We have been told to seek out [Sir Henry]({{< ref "Sir Henry" >}}) to see what we should do with these people.
