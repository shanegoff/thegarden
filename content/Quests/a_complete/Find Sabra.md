[Sabra]({{< ref "Sabra" >}}) might be able to help us with [Find the Fragments of Magnus]({{< ref "Find the Fragments of Magnus" >}}) and [Find our way home]({{< ref "Find our way home" >}}). We should look for her near [Urdye]({{< ref "Urdye" >}}).

We have found Sabra and she has asked we help with a few things before she helps us.

- Someone is taking the locals
- ~~[Help Vermilla]({{< ref "Help Vermilla" >}}) at the temple~~
- Learn about the goblin in the pointy hat

We discovered that [Camryn]({{< ref "Camryn" >}}) was kidnapping locals in [Urdye]({{< ref "Urdye" >}}) and stopped him.
