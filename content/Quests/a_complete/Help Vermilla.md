There appears to be unrest at the [[Temple of the Sanguine hand]], the worshipers are unhappy with the way [[Vermilla]] is running things at their temple in [[Urdye]]. They are required to follow certain rules to remain in the city, but the worshipers are unhappy with the rules.

[[Sabra]] has asked us to aid [[Vermilla]] with the unrest before she will help us [[Find our way home]].
