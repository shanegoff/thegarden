[a_Active]({{< ref "a_Active" >}})

There appears to be unrest at the [Temple of the Sanguine hand]({{< ref "Temple of the Sanguine hand" >}}), the worshipers are unhappy with the way [Vermilla]({{< ref "Vermilla" >}}) is running things at their temple in [Urdye]({{< ref "Urdye" >}}). They are required to follow certain rules to remain in the city, but the worshipers are unhappy with the rules.

[Sabra]({{< ref "Sabra" >}}) has asked us to aid [Vermilla]({{< ref "Vermilla" >}}) with the unrest before she will help us [Find our way home]({{< ref "Find our way home" >}}).
