There are a number of identical beggars around town that don't seem to know each other. There are at least seven of them.

We found them and took them all to [Andrea]({{< ref "Andrea" >}}) and kept them in their basement.

We found out they are coming from the mountains where a human wizard lives.

We investigated the mountains and found [Theo]({{< ref "Theo" >}}). He is making the Jerrys to try and move his mind into a young body. This didn't seem to bother [Sabra]({{< ref "Sabra" >}}) so we left it alone.
