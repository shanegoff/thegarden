There are a number of identical beggars around town that don't seem to know each other. There are at least seven of them.

We found them and took them all to [[Andrea]] and kept them in their basement.

We found out they are coming from the mountains where a human wizard lives.

We investigated the mountains and found [[Theo]]. He is making the Jerrys to try and move his mind into a young body. This didn't seem to bother [[Sabra]] so we left it alone.
