[[a_Complete]]

Someone has been kidnapping locals in Urdye. The blood mother wants us to track them down.

After having been asked to do this [[Kamrys]] went missing so this time it's personal. 

We tracked [[Kamrys]] down, he was in a warehouse and was kidnapped by a human wizard [[Camryn]]. We rescued [[Kamrys]] and supe the kidnappings.
