The goblin with the pointy hat has been identified as "the Great Bartamus 'The pointed'"
He seems to be with some kind of cult. He is with the [Temple of Confractus]({{< ref "Temple of Confractus" >}}) which is working to bring back [Magnus]({{< ref "Magnus" >}}) and live by the laws and principals that existed under his rule. These guys are obviously shitters but the crowd is really rolling with him so we decided to just gather intel and leave. 

The nearest temple of confractus is near [Astrum]({{< ref "Astrum" >}}).

Alondrus has been cursed with some kind of madness. After killing a halfling barbarian on the road I became cursed. The curse changes every time I wake up. My current curse is "Being drunk keeps me the sanest I've been in days"

The last development occurred when we went to bed for the night. In the morning we woke up and found [Asani Blackbriar]({{< ref "Asani Blackbriar" >}}) is missing. We have [Sabra]({{< ref "Sabra" >}}) with us, and she will escort us to find her. 

We are standing in Assanis room with blood all over the place. Sabra said it looks like she jumped out the window to escape her attackers.

# Some other last time
Last time we went to the wizard in the mountain, killed some of his dudes, looted his shit, drank his tea, and found out he was making the Jerrys.

Mountain wizard was named Theo.  [Sabra]({{< ref "Sabra" >}}) didn't seem put off by the Jerrys so we let that be.
